	  	    	 	   	   	    IPL Data Analysis Project – Summary
 Data Preparation:
- Cleaned and preprocessed IPL data from matches.csv and deliveries.csv.
- Merged datasets using match_id to connect match-level and ball-by-ball data.
- Handled missing values (e.g., winner, city, player_of_match) using forward fill/mode.
- Encoded categorical features (teams, venues, decisions) using LabelEncoder.

Key Insights:
- Mumbai Indians emerged as the most successful team in IPL history.
- Toss winners had a slight advantage (win rate ~51%) but not a guaranteed win.
- Powerplay (overs 1–6) and death overs (overs 16–20) showed significant impact on total scores.
- Venue-based scoring trends highlighted Wankhede and Chinnaswamy as batting-friendly.

Predictive Modeling:
Implemented 3 ML models to predict match winners:
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 47.71%
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 43.84%
- Random Forest Accuracy: **58.27%** (best performer)

Random Forest outperformed others due to its ensemble learning strength, reducing overfitting and capturing complex team-match interactions.

 Conclusion:
- Predicting IPL outcomes is challenging due to cricket’s dynamic nature.
- Machine Learning can provide smart assistance, but not certainty.
- This analysis serves as a solid base for future real-time prediction tools, fantasy league advisors, or IPL strategy dashboards.

Future Scope:
- Integrate live player form, pitch reports, and weather conditions.
- Deploy as an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash.
- Expand to WPL, ICC tournaments, and T20 leagues for global insights.

Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
